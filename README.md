# familyquiz

I put together this super simple quiz site, and hosted it on one of my servers, to give some family members some nice easy access to a simple quiz app. I used a lot of James Q Quicks tutorial on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8&t=6s. 

I altered it a bit to remove the feedback so users can't memorise answers and I increased the question numbers. 

## Plans

I'm planning to implement some changes, and allow the user to select the category, and the amount of questions they face.
